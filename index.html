                This page demonstrates how to use the CSS Box Model with margins, padding, and borders.

                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML is the standard language used to structure content on the web.

It defines the elements on a page — like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, forms, etc.

Think of it as the skeleton of a webpage — it gives meaning and order to content but doesn’t control how it looks.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>CSS is the language used to style HTML content — controlling colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and more.

It’s like the clothing and makeup for HTML — it decides how the structure appears to users.

CSS can be applied inline, inside a <style> tag, or in an external .css file.</p>
